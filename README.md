# Crystal Game

This is a simple html game that uses jQuery for DOM manipulation.

The game is simple.

You've got a value to match. The way to match the value is to press the gems that are displayed on the screen. The catch is that you do not know the value of the gems. You have to figure that part of.

If you match the number you win. But if you pass it you lose.
